# Face Detection and Recognition with ESP-EYE

This example demonstrates **Face Recognition** and **Voice Wakeup** with ESP-EYE.

For hardware preparation, please see [HERE](../../../docs/en/get-started/ESP-EYE_Getting_Started_Guide.md)

# Key Features

- Voice wakeup
- Face detection
- Face recognition

# Key Process

The figure below describes the workflow of ESP-EYE:

![esp-eye-workflow](../../../docs/_static/get-started/work_flow_en.png)

#### 1. Voice Wake-up 

ESP-EYE awaits to be woken up after powering up (Red LED on and white LED off). The board wakes up after recognizing the wake-up command "Hi Lexin" ([Ləsɪ:n]), and then awaits for networking (Red LED flashing and white LED off). Subsequently, users can initiate the networking.

#### 2. Networking

Users can connect their PCs or mobile phones to ESP-EYE's Wi-Fi (by default), with the following information:

- Username: esp-eye-xxxx (xxxx should be the board's MAC address)
- Password: not needed

Alternatively, users can also follow the steps below to configure the username and password of the board's Wi-Fi connection:

- Launch your Terminal.
- Run `make menuconfig` and complete the configuration, as instructed in the figure below:

> Note: After reconfiguring the Wi-Fi username and password, you will have to restart from the point of downloading firmware.

#### 3. Face Detection

ESP-EYE starts the face detection after networking. Users can see the real-time image captured by the board, through their browser (address: `192.168.4.1/face_stream`). During this step, the red LED is off and the white LED is on.

#### 4. Face Recognition

After detecting a face, ESP-EYE will start the face 
recognition if there are any enrolled Face IDs stored in the board:

- When there is a match, the red LED on the board flashes once and the browser displays **HELLO ID XXX**.
- When there is no match, the board shows no signs and the browser displays **WHO?**.

If there is no enrolled Face ID, the board continues the face-detecting process. You should enroll at least one Face ID if you want to start face 
recognition.

#### 5. Add/delete a Face ID

The users can add/delete a Face ID after the network is successfully established.

##### 5.1 Add a Face ID

![Enroll a Face ID](../../../docs/_static/get-started/face_id_enrollment_en.png)

- Single-click the Side Tactile Button to enroll a new Face ID. At this point, the red LED is on and the browser displays **START ENROLLING**;
- Once you put a face in front of the camera, the face-sampling starts automatically. The red LED flashes whenever the board gets a face sample and the browser displays the ordinal number of the current face sample, i.e. **THE 1st SAMPLE** etc. By default, the board has to take three samples to add one Face ID. Users can configure the number of samples needed for one Face ID. (Please adjust your position/distance from the camera and try again if you cannot see the red LED flashing for some time).
- After the Face ID enrollment, the red LED on the board is off and the browser displays **ENROLLED FACE ID XXX**;
- The board enters Face Detection after the Face ID enrollment.

Currently, ESP-EYE can enroll up to 10 Face IDs. Please note that the maximum number of enrolled Face IDs can be configured according to how users allocate the flash memory.

##### 5.2 Delete a Face ID

- Single-click the Top Tactile Button "BOOT" to delete an existing Face ID.
- After that, the board deletes the earliest record of all the existing enrolled Face IDs. The white LED on the board flashes, and the browser displays: **XXX ID(S) LEFT**.

#### Troubleshooting

The board returns to the "awaiting to be woken up" status when there are network anomalies, such as "network disconnection" and "network timeout".
